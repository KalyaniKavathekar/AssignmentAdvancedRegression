## General Information
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
    Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
    How well those variables describe the price of a house.
